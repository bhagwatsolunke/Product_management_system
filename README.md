This is a Java-based web application that serves as a Product Management System. It leverages Java Servlets, JDBC for database connectivity, and JSP pages for dynamic web content rendering. The primary goal of this application is to provide a user-friendly interface for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on product data stored in a MySQL database. Users can easily add new products, view existing ones, update product details, and delete products, making it a robust tool for managing product inventories or catalogs.
